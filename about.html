                     If your checking out this page, that likely means your
                    looking for a solution to a common problem that many people today experience.<br>
                    You need help with a website.</br>
                    I've been there. As a small business owner who has started several ventures, the importance of creating
                    a visible online presence was never lost on me. The decisions were how to use the limited start-up ressources
                    to ensure the maximum value and get the best results. Often this led me to use many of the common site builders 
                    that are so popular today. They were okay, but they took time to build and maintain and were
                    limited in scope.Then of course there was S.E.O and how do you even start to figure that out...<br><br> Sound familiar? <br><br>

                    Well don't worry! I can help! <br>

                    A recent graduate of Innotechs web development program, and with some new,
                    powerful skills in website development technologies, I can take that very common problem
                    that so many people face in business, and provide a great  solution. My skills include creating
                    beautiful, mobile responsive sites that are optimized to  search engine algorithms.
                    This will ensure your business not only looks good on any device, but will have maximum visibilty
                    online.<br><br>

                    I love business! I get passionate about start-ups and the entrepenurial journey. Starting a business is not easy,
                    and having a great website is key. I would love to help!
